4>ALGORITHM:REVERSE THE NUMBER
	1)Taken the user input as number.
	2)Using goto label we are giving the condition.
	3)if the remainder greater than zero only it will go into loop.
	4)Using that equation like,rev=rev*10+rem we are finding and storing it.
	5)Check number!=0 otherwise it will exit from the condition.
	6)print the reverse number.
