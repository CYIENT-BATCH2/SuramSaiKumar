7>ALGORITHM:PALINDROME OR NOT
	1)We are taking the variable as temp,number,rem and rev.
	2)First we have to store that number into temp varaible.
	3)if the remainder is greater than zero only it will enter into the condition.
	4)Like,rev=rev*10+rem and number is stored in rev.
	5)Check if temp is equality of rev only it will print as palindrome.
	6)Otherwise it will print as Not palindrome.
